Graph Visualizer — Course Submission
===================================

Files:
- index.html : single-page web app with canvas and algorithms

How to use:
1. Extract the zip and open index.html in a browser (or host on any static server).
2. Add nodes by selecting 'Add Node' mode and clicking.
3. Create edges by selecting 'Add Edge' and dragging from a node to another node. Set 'Graph type' to Directed if needed.
4. Use controls for BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Bipartite check, Hierholzer, Ford-Fulkerson.
5. Save graph to JSON using 'Save JSON' or load with 'Load JSON'.

Notes:
- This is a compact single-file starter project. It contains working implementations for add node/edge, BFS/DFS visualization steps, Dijkstra shortest path (basic), Kruskal MST highlight, bipartite check and coloring, Hierholzer partial Euler routine, and an Edmonds-Karp like Ford-Fulkerson maxflow calculation.
- For full-feature polish (animations, robust UI, better Euler & Fleury implementations), extend in React + D3 as optional upgrade.
